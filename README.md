# Sieve-of-Eratosthenes
Using the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all prime numbers between 0- 10^6.

This Java program implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes to efficiently find and count prime numbers up to a specified limit. 
The program initializes a boolean array to represent numbers, marking multiples of each prime as non-prime. 
It includes methods to initialize the sieve and check for primality. The program outputs all prime numbers, counts them, 
and measures the execution time for the process. This showcases algorithmic optimization and computational efficiency, 
suitable for handling large data sets (e.g., up to 1,000,000).
